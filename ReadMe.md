#How to run
Every excercise contains all needed packages to import in ros, just copy and past them inside a `[NAME_WS]/src`.

In some exercises some packages are repeated with the same name, those are the exactly same one.
They are repeated to make it simpler to execute only one exercise, if multiple exercises are going to be run only a package of those is needed

To know how to run every specific exercise please check read me inside every relative directory.

Once files are located in the workspace a `catkin build` it is needed (I suggest to use `catkin clean` before that)
