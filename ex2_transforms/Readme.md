# Fanuc moveit config and parse
In fanuc_description, urdf and meshes of the fanuc are provided

fanuc_moveit_config has been generated by moveit setup but moveit.rviz has been modified manually to be used correctly in the other excercises

tf_parser parses all informations from every joint and translates in human readable text output featuring rotation matrix, axis/angle and euler angles

## How to run

to execute, first launch demo.launch

```bash
roslaunch fanuc_moveit_config demo.launch
```

then run tf_parser node. Every movement manually made in rviz will be followed by its documentation in ros console

```bash
rosrun tf_parser tf_parser
```
